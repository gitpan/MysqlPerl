This is a Perl adaptor for the MySQL database. You'll need it
if you have perl programs designed for the msql/PerlMsql team
and want to adapt them to the mysql server (replacing the msql
server).

This is ABSOLUTELY "BETA" and not tested thoroughly. However,
the "msql.t" and "pmsql" utilities that were included with
MsqlPerl-1.16 are working fine with this replacement (and
are included here, too).

The code in this package is
Copyright (c) 1994-1997 Andreas König <a.koenig@mind.de>

Changes have been made by Michael Widenius <monty@analytikerna.se>
and Frederik Ramm <ramm@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de> to the effect that 
nobody knows why certain things aren't working. Please see the
"Changes" file for latest news. 

How to install:
* perl Makefile.PL
* make
* make install

I (Fred) have deleted the rest of this README, see the original 
MsqlPerl docs for more.
